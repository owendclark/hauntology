        <h3>Overview of Hauntology</h3>
        <p>Hauntology finds its origins in the 1993 book by Jacques Derrida, "Specters of Marx." Derrida's
          original word and concept describe the effects of the Soviet Union/ USSR on European politics and
          society in the modern world. Haunting Europe beyond Communism's grave in a sense. However, when the
          concept of hauntology is used to analyze art, the word takes on some new ideasâ€”popularized by
          philosopher Mark Fisher. When examining art under a hauntology lens, it is essential to understand
          the concept of "Lost Futures" and the feeling of nostalgia they evoke. "Lost Futures" is the concept
          that the capitalist and future technological utopias seemingly promised by the advertisements,
          dancehall tracks, and retro-futuristic art of the '70s, the '80s, and '90s have been compromised,
          leaving humans in stages of late capitalism, looking upon the past visions of the future with loving
          nostalgia. This societal phenomenon can be observed in musical and other artistic mediums. On this
          blog, we will dissect "Eccojams vol. 1" by Chuck Person, "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare, and the
          1954 film "Godzilla" by Ishiro Honda with an original culture analysis piece written by Owen Clark
          and Nathan Shad.</p>
