        <h3>Lost Futures</h3>
        <p>
          Nostalgia culture is one of the defining characteristics of contemporary time. The effect of this
          culture is seen most prominently in the art we consume, specifically fashion, movies, and music.
          More than ever, present aesthetics are recycled from the past, with a reliance on the '70s, '80s,
          and '90s. Instead of moving forward, culture is moving in a circle, consuming already established
          tropes and ideas. We believe this circular cannibalistic motion can be attributed to the nature of
          late-stage capitalism, forcing artists to use past formulas and images that are proven to sell
          instead of taking time and financial risk to advance art forward. This is the idea which the concept
          of frozen time is based upon in hauntology. In a scientific sense, Einstein explained it has not
          stopped moving, but humans do not perceive time in this scientific manner. Humans perceive time via
          differences in aesthetics, shown by how we divide the different generations by their varying iconic
          art and images. However, because aesthetics currently rely on past ideas, culture has stopped moving
          forward and now has begun to fold back upon the past. Popular fashion in modern times is one of the
          most accessible places to look and observe the circular recycling of aesthetics, most prominently,
          in the casual and haute-couture fashion house worlds of the art form. When looking at the fashion of
          everyday people, society for the past few years has been in a circular motion of moving between
          previously established fashion tropes of the past three decades. Just walking through the Wolfson
          hallways, you see students wearing high-waisted bell-bottom jeans and converse, a look emulated from
          the pop culture of the '70s and '80s. Or maybe you'll see someone in all black, based on punk
          aesthetics of the counterculture movements of the '80s, or someone in their grandpa's vintage
          cardigan. The love for vintage and previous generations, to this extent, is unique to the
          21st-century culture. Any sense of 21st-century fashion is focused on the past rather than the
          future on which previous generations focused. Even in the more artistic realms of fashion, there is
          only nostalgic thought and creation occurring on that level. For the past years, famous clothing
          powerhouse Gucci under its current designer Alessandro Michele has been fascinated with the concept
          of recycling looks from the '70s and from the brand's golden age, which coincided with that time.
          Gucci's last show, "Love Parade," their spring 2022 collection, this idea is on display. With
          callbacks to old iconic pieces by the house and an abundance of golden age Hollywood looks with a
          slightly avant-garde twist. Gucci is not alone in this cultural phenomenon, but many fashion houses
          have ditched the modern for the retro. The same circular motion of aesthetics can be noted in
          mainstream music, with ostensibly an overabundance of nostalgia culture for the synthpop and dance
          tracks of the '80s and '90s. Sonically, many modern albums rely upon established vintage sounds and
          chord progressions. A great example of this is Tyler the Creators 2019 release "Igor," which shows a
          tremendous amount of homage towards the Europop of the 80's such as Tears for Fears or The Style
          Council. The glittery synths, major chord progressions, love ballads, tour posters, clothing, and
          set design for the live shows all resemble the established aesthetic of the '80s. Even the concept
          of "futuristic music" has been lost. The futuristic sounds of the '90s became the genre's norm,
          never progressing past those sounds and adapting to the modern day. What caused the abundance of
          nostalgia culture in today's pop culture? When and why did innovation towards the future seemingly
          stop? To answer this question, we'll turn to the world of film, specifically film from Soviet-era
          Russia. Under the rule of Vladimir Lenin, Soviet Russia gave birth to the first film school, the
          All-Union Institute of Cinematography. At the All-Union Institute of Cinematography, the basis of
          the modern film was created. The innovations in editing and cinematography can be felt in cinema
          today. How were the Soviets able to develop such forward-thinking and groundbreaking art ahead of
          its time? The answer seems to be state funding. Without worrying about creating a profit from their
          artistic expressions and only focusing on creating art itself, we believe this allowed Soviet
          filmmakers a seemingly unmatched expressive freedom that capitalist society can not provide for its
          artist. While state funding does generate some controversy, with the state controlling the film's
          message, the art created outweighs the censorship in this case. George Lucas, the director of the
          original Star Wars trilogy, was quoted stating, "I'd say, well, I know a lot of Russian filmmakers,
          and they have a lot more freedom than I have." When artists must worry about creating a profit to
          continue making their self-expression, their artistic freedom is taken awayâ€”causing an overreliance
          on past formulas which have proven to make a reliable profit. Capitalism takes away resources from
          artists to create boundary-pushing art through the lack of state support and other monetary factors.
          This claim is supported by the waves of art occurring under capitalist societies, often in response
          to an economic shift. For example, the punk subcultures in London and New York in the late 1970s and
          early 1980s coincided with a time of the cheap property. It increased social housing in those
          cities, taking an amount of financial burden off artists, allowing this new form of expression to
          emerge. In conclusion, the principle of the freezing of time in hauntology is based on the idea that
          capitalism creates a cultural circle, reusing past artistic identities instead of thinking forward
          towards innovations. One of the primary causes of this effect is capitalisms burden of profit
          incentive, which is placed upon creatives, limiting their self-expression to forms that they know
          will create a profit. With no eyes towards the future, only looking upon our past, seemingly our
          future has been lost.
