        <h3>Hamlet</h3>
        <p>Hamlet exists as possibly one of the greatest absurdist works of literature, and providing a complete
          analysis of the work through Hauntology is near impossible. However, it does give a great example of
          ideas of Hauntology in art while also predating the school of thought itself. Hamlet is haunted and
          crazed by visions of his dead father and the messages to kill his uncle, who betrayed him. Hamlet
          becomes relevant to Hauntology when viewing Hamlet as the modern man, with his dead father
          representing the past. Humans in hauntology are haunted by the visions of the past's future utopia.
          And their subsequential failure to carry out and make those visions a reality, constantly tormented
          by the reality they couldn't make for themselves. The past never leaves the modern alone, like the
          nature of Hamlet's father, who is omnipresent throughout the story. Richard Flatters' analysis
          explains the nature of Hamlet's ghost and the past the best. "Can we ever say that he ceases to be
          there? He is not there in person, but in principle, so to speak; not visible all the time, but all
          the time perceptible—by the task, he has laid on his son's shoulders…The motive of the play is the
          ghost's; and in this sense, it may be said, it is his play". The importance of Hamlet's story to
          hauntology is the principle of the omnipresence of the past. Constantly influencing and controlling
          the modern, forever dictating the actions and the future culture in the case of hauntology. The
          incapability for the contemporary to escape the past is what hauntology is all about. The
          reoccurring of past culture and trauma in pop media and art of the 21st century is no different from
          his dead father's role in Hamlet's own life.</p>
