        <h3>Eccojams Vol.1</h3>
        <p>
          Eccojams musically expresses the ideas of hauntology by sampling primarily 80’s pop songs, and
          remixing them into hazy, slowed down, repetitive, beautiful watered-down messes. Created by Chuck
          Person, the heavy use of sampling the past shows the eyes of younger generations being focused on
          the history and making a commentary on the nature of drug use and work culture under western
          capitalism. Daniel Lopatin did not even the wheel, building his sound of the work of the hip-hop
          mastermind DJ Screw, who gained fame by altering rap cassette tapes to create a similar sonic
          landscape as Eccojams; however,,, the message sent from their sonic landscapes is entirely
          different. DJ Screw emulated the feelings of the use of the drugs marijuana and “lean” ( a drink
          containing an opiate called codeine), Chuck Person meant to mimic the sensations of Prozac. This is
          where hauntology begins to incorporate itself in the philosophy of Eccojams, the feelings of
          hopelessness and loss of living in a society with “lost futures” and the frozen nature of time and
          culture under late capitalism. To deal with these feelings, the use of Prozac begins to become more
          common, a response drug to the living situation caused by capitalism, but also to increase their
          productivity, morphing the human brain. Broadening the scope from Prozac, here are some statistics
          of anti-depressant use under late-stage capitalistic America as of November 2017.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>12.7% of the US population over the age of 12 is actively taking a form of anti-depressant
            medication.</li>
          <li>64% increase in usage from 1999 to 2014, with previously only 7.7% of the population using
            medication.</li>
          <li>Of course, depression rates are on the rise as well, especially in youth, moving from 6.6% of
            the population to 7.3% from 2005 to 2015 in the general population, and with the youth (ages
            12-17) increasing from 8.7% to 12.7%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          What's the diagnosis for this troubling issue in America? While being an accumulation of multiple
          factors, hauntology and eccojams focus on the roles of technology in these statistics. In a sense,
          technology has betrayed the future assigned to it by its retrofuture origins. Then, visions of
          humans coexisting and reaping benefits from technology were typical imagery, but now technology
          seems to rule over humans in fields of social life and labor. The human brain is trying to learn to
          adapt to the digital and keep up with constant stimulation, causing immense stress, which is where
          anti-depressants are used to cure the symptoms of modern technology-fueled life. Eccojams creates a
          beautiful sonic representation of this conflict between humans and technology.
