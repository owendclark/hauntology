        <h3>Godzilla</h3>
        <p>
          The Monster of Past Memories and Cultures
          One of the best places to apply hauntology is pop media, which is the most culturally defining and
          universal form of art in modern times. Hauntology is used to analyze these art forms, breaking down
          the past's omnipresent effects on art and cultural thought, a constant factor but intangible.
          Godzilla provides a compelling art form to look at with a lens of hauntology, breaking down the
          collective shared trauma of World War Two and Japan's imperial past. But first, a quick rundown of
          the plot from the original 1954 film.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Godzilla is awoken by American nuclear bombs rising from the Pacific Ocean.</li>
          <li>Politicians and military leaders struggle to stop the beast, has Godzilla continues to demolish
            cities and kill civilians successfully.</li>
          <li>Dr. Serizawa is called to help the fight against this supernatural monster, using research to
            create an "Oxygen Destroyer" which could stop the beast.</li>
          <li>Dr. Serizawa fears his creation, feeling immense guilt for what the weapon could become,
            mimicking the nuclear bomb which caused such pain to his people and country.</li>
          <li>When shown footage of hospitals and city wreckage, Dr. Serizawa uses his weapon, sending the
            beast back into the Pacific Ocean. Still, after his success, he destroys the Oxygen Destroyer
            and any blueprints and takes his own life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Godzilla is commonly analyzed as just a movie based on principles of post-war trauma of the nukes
          and World War Two, which would be enough to classify it as hauntological art. However, I believe
          that many more factors are at play, stemming from Japan's own cultural identity and trauma before
          the war. Godzilla represents the shame, guilt, and lost feelings of Japanese soldiers and civilians
          after the war and the horrors of the two nukes that destroyed parts of their nation. Before World
          War Two, Japan was in a period of history labeled the "Meji era" defined by their emperor's
          supernatural and heavenly rule. It was a period of incredibly high nationalism caused by the
          governments' ability to ascend reality with its divine mandate. These feelings of intense
          nationalism persisted into the war until defeat. Under the Meji period, with the unshaken support of
          the people, the emperor began a series of military attacks into China, campaigns notorious in
          modern-day for their brutality, the most known being the Nanjing Massacre. Godzilla turns the
          supernatural back onto the Japanese, embodying a creature of karma. The supernatural, which once was
          used to justify the war crimes of Imperial Japan, was now being used to destroy and tear apart their
          own country. This flip of the supernatural is shown in history by the surrender of the imperial
          Japanese nation to America after two nukes were dropped in World War Two, when the emperor was
          forced to announce the terms of surrender on Japanese public radio, debunking his status of God.
          With that, the collective Japanese nationalist consciousness is forced to reconcile with their
          violent past and face their atrocities. This reconciliation and Japanese guilt, which followed World
          War Two, is embodied by Godzilla; Japan must fight and destroy their history. The past, which
          continues to haunt them, as Godzilla does in movies, constantly reappears in newer adapted forms, so
          does Japanese nationalism. A key component of hauntology is the inability for modernity to escape
          the past, always being dictated by it. Godzilla never dies, returning to slumber until he appears
          again in future movies. Japanese extreme and violent nationalism is the same, appearing in the
          politics of Japan even post World War Two after the emperor and imperial Japanese government had
          been replaced by their Western democracy and the atrocities of their past reemerging in modern
          politics. "The Tatenokai" was an extreme right-wing armed militia in Japan in the late 1960s. A
          haunting of their past imperialism manifested in the form of this group, a last stand of sorts for
          the traditional ways of Japanese imperialism destroyed by the two nukes. Led by Japanese author
          Yukio Mishima, the Tatenokai swore to bring back the holy nature of the emperor, a call to the past,
          breaking the trauma of violence by returning to a time and nationalistic state where those actions
          were acceptable. On November 25, 1970, Yukio Mishima and four of his followers staged a coup, taking
          control of the Japanese military headquarters, hoping to rally troops to his cause of nationalism.
          However, this attempt to return to an imperial empire failed, resulting in the suicide of Yukio
          Mishima. We can undoubtedly draw parallels to the suicide of Dr. Serizawa from Godzilla to Yukio
          Mishima's death. The haunting of their countries' past fueled both. Dr. Serizawa's suicide was
          caused by the haunting of human violence on his nation. The war crimes Japan suffered and the
          consequences that followed for generations (represented physically by Godzilla).
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast, Yukio Mishima's suicide was caused by a "lost future" of Japanese imperialism; Japan
          had entered a deep state of neoliberalism and capitalism persisting even till the present, never
          being capable of returning to the traditional structure which Mishima desired. In conclusion,
          Godzilla is a physical returning of Japan's past traumas of war atrocities committed on themselves
          and the terrors inflicted upon others. Godzilla never disappears, always presenting an ominous and
          invisible threat off the coast of fictional Japan, but always there. These ideas are vital concepts
          in hauntology and its view of past trauma, making Godzilla a compelling tale of collective societal
          consciousness.

              One of the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan, resulting in the death of approximately
              anywhere between 129,000-226,000 people. The effects of these nukes could be physically
              and emotionally felt for generations, creating a societally shared trauma which spanned
              across generations and which would become a common theme in Japanese media, as well has
              physically witnessing the loss of these two cities, and resulting radiation passed the
              detonation which took the lives of many more innocent civilians. Image captured by Enola
